<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Today the major progress was on the discussion with professor. Several modification was applied on the components. Got and gripper rather than PhanTom Omni, directly controlling the sensing from the hand. However, hardware needed to be maintained with software programming.<br /><br />The major thing that solved today was the Orphan-CYTON VETA that being forgotten from Robai. They no longer support this device for three years... However, I would like to share the files, from the back-up of the Network Lab pal's backup from the past, which is the CYTON package!<br /><br />Here is several info I would like to tell and to remember:<br />Also the rules before you doing anything on Ubuntu<br />1. Installing the correct version of Linux<br />2. Setting up the C++ Environment (To comply the file)<br />3. Setting up the Python Environment (Specifically for CYTON)<br />4. Install ROS<br /><br />If you need the file of cytonviewer for CYTON-VETA, let me know (Email:lanking520@gmail.com)<br /><br />In this case, a big progress with the hardware, some nodes are pre-established in the package. Next stage is the selection of the Force sensor and the arduino bridge.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-72zZJkkdIis/VhOhjFJiTmI/AAAAAAAAANA/cKCSpetpv0Q/s1600/IMG_4471.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-72zZJkkdIis/VhOhjFJiTmI/AAAAAAAAANA/cKCSpetpv0Q/s320/IMG_4471.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-36b4DLGrY5Q/Vg2GegTDqAI/AAAAAAAAAMo/JRd3WqbzvnE/s1600/WIN_20151001_20_15_42_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-36b4DLGrY5Q/Vg2GegTDqAI/AAAAAAAAAMo/JRd3WqbzvnE/s320/WIN_20151001_20_15_42_Pro.jpg" width="320" /></a></div></div>
