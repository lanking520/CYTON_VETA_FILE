<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Since my hardware has not arrived yet, I got a week's breath in doing the network stuff. But it does not mean no progress in the hardware section. Basically the CYTON-VETA controller has been re-adjust with more limitation on avoiding self-collision.<br /><br />MPU-6050: Last time using this gyro+accelerometer module was a year ago. Hand it on again and hoping it would actually sending back the signals. Using accelerometer (integration)&nbsp;+ gyroscope data, the final angle was much stabilized and accurate! It's a milestone to do the sub-project, wearable motion detector (Similar to X-IMU but cost less than Â£30).<br /><br />Sweet, Valerio and me work it out by using USB/IP library and Virtualhere Module. At least the robotic arm USB signal could be sent between computers. Just the issue of the FTDI vs Arduino Yun.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kG2ZQZJHy2U/VrzCeeOczVI/AAAAAAAAASI/dexL2l-GjTA/s1600/IMG_5559.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kG2ZQZJHy2U/VrzCeeOczVI/AAAAAAAAASI/dexL2l-GjTA/s320/IMG_5559.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /></div>
