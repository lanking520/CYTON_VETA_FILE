<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Here comes to the third week and after planting the SimpleGUI on my laptop, I could finally build up a GUI for my sensors. However, there is some issues of the remote charging, using battery to replace the USB charger. The major topic of this week is the tasks arrangement, through the planning of several milestones. <br /><br />After Weeks of time on Information Collection Here comes to the current tasks:<br /><br />1. Do tutorials of ROS operation<br />2. Using SimpleGUI Build up the control pad and sensing terminal<br />3. Do tutorials of URDF Creation<br />4. Getting more command on the joint value received<br />5. Refresh the previous task plan: Can we add motion planning function?</div>
