<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Thanks to Dr. Valerio's help, now I could finally work on the Internet emulation, cannot wait to see what happned in &nbsp;distant network transmission. This section will be updated in the following days.<br /><br />For the controlling section, in software stage, the servo and motor on robotic arm can be synchronized! With the aid of PI controlling method (Velocity). &nbsp;Now serious work should be on the Servo. Previously, although my servo was adjusted into the velocity change, it still working on the maximum speed to get to the desired position (imagine the speed change like a square wave), now I am trying to make it like a ramp but feel like a critically damped model. In this case, it won't overshoot and get too far from the position I desired. By changing the bandwidth of PWM, This function could be achieved. Will finish this week.<br /><br />Finally in Monday and Tuesday, I've been working on the 'function generator', a program I designed to generate the Deformation vs Pressure map. It will automatically generate the formula using polyfit, a formula in Matlab in Numpy package used to calculate the polynomial line for the curve. You will see the post later this week.<br /><br />Got my gripper animation class working for all module, this will much help to see what command had sent to the hardware. Hope I still have the time to work on 3D animation and my wearable gyroscope.<br /><br />A lot work to do, trying my best.<br /><br />P.S: Horray! We got the opportunities to host NASA Space App Challenge 2016 in Liverpool! Got connection to NYC in the next 30 minutes!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-19tPhWoqPEM/Vs24ZP9mGXI/AAAAAAAAATs/rKINBWPRtlI/s1600/Screenshot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="270" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-19tPhWoqPEM/Vs24ZP9mGXI/AAAAAAAAATs/rKINBWPRtlI/s320/Screenshot.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div>[Update] Auto generate the relationship of the graph</div></div>
