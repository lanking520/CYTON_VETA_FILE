<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">As previously in the years of my studied, I used Infrared sensor to detect the distance and also the Ultrasonic sensor. Bluetooth (HC-05) Module and RF-433MHz Module to send/receive data. The most common method we are using is the WiFi, at 2.4GHz or 5GHz level.<br /><br />If we do comparison between these signals, Infrared sensor with high frequency are hardly to transmit some data in a wide range of area. It could only do point to point transmission and that's means you should only point to it and use it. Another flaws for this method is the interference of the other signal, because every person and device could send infrared light (although we cannot see them), and it can hardly reach to the transmission frequency (up to Trillion Bytes/second). In this frequency, the hardware cannot easily adjust its passing signal without and glitch or propagations. In this case, we can only see them appear in the past, in 2000s, you are using a phone (Motorola, Sony) to send data through infrared signal in a very short distance. Is there any method to solve this problem? The Optical-Fiber, or we generally consider them as the visible light. By using a certain solid material, the signal could pass through a optical wire without much losses, and the result is very appealing and that's why we can see their application everywhere.<br /><br />Alternatively, that's the point I am going to say today, can we actually do it wirelessly, like Wifi? Li-Fi, a new way of communication. However, this part is still under the evaluation stage.</div>
