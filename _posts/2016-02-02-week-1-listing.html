<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So far everything are working on smoothly, the game-pad were successfully tested yesterday. So today we could finally get rid of the keyboard, enjoy the joypad in controlling the 7 DOF arm. Another thing is the redundancy... Well, after checking with my MNFG course this week, it seemed that generally 6 DOF are most commonly used structure working on robotic arm. Furthermore, my delta 3D printer seemed to be the most precise structure. Anyway, let's start up today's tasks,<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cliEfjuhbow/VrB1tJdpazI/AAAAAAAAARg/3DfVN_ItFsE/s1600/Capture.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="221" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cliEfjuhbow/VrB1tJdpazI/AAAAAAAAARg/3DfVN_ItFsE/s320/Capture.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: left;">Start up a new day, hope everything would goes well.</div></div>
