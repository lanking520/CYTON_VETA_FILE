<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">During the last two days, I was working on taking video clips of the things that I have done. However, a unexpected crack happened in the UDP connection attract my eyes. It seemed previously even if I have adjust the settings in the socket, the UDP stuff is not installed, so that's TCP/IP still. After I figure it out and discuss with Valerio, UDP connection is much unsafe but extremely easy for data transmission.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>As an example, in TCP/IP connection, Sever need to wait for a client to connect to it. After the request of the connection, the client side will receive a permission from Server to establish the connection. &nbsp;During the transmission, there are also more verifying method, like timeout session to make sure the connection is complete. This is why people would more likely to use TCP/IP in file transfer. It originally have the functionality to detect the corrupted packet.</div><div><br /></div><div>Alternatively, UDP is powerful for its simplicity, there is no need for client to wait for permission from the server, it just send the data without caring even if the port is not open! (Of course you may receive some error message from the Client). The server side will receive two data in a packet: The thing you sent from the Client and the IP address and the port you have sent to. Why they also add IP address and Port? Because it initially permit the data transmission from multiple device, that's it! It is unsafe because nobody will tell if the package is complete or not and nobody could say it came from one computer or multiples. However, in the long distance communication, UDP seemed to be powerful in some cases when we don't care if there is some data losses: such as the online game, Skype chat or other sort of communication.</div><div><br /></div><div>For the gripper controller, yesterday, I have confirmed with professor, the speed control is purely linear, it follow the equation shown below:</div><div>Delta_Pressure = Target_pressure - Current_Pressure (Target: Haptic, Current: Robot arm)</div><div>Velocity = Delta_Pressure * a (a is a constant coefficient)</div><div>Robot_Gripper_position = Previous_position&nbsp;+ Velocity * t (t is the refreshing time, 50ms)</div><div><br /></div><div>From the equations above, the velocity control is not linear. that may cause the system to be over damped. In this case, I am thinking if that's possible to add another term in the pressure side, we track on the slope of the pressure change, add a new term inside (Integral Part) to complete a PI controller in the velocity. Will think about it after the bench.</div><div><br /></div><div>By the way, after learning the Robotic resources from USC (CS574) find the way to calculate the D-H matrices. I have drawn a sketch of this. See it below:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaYTanCr7Eo/Vt_0_g1IWuI/AAAAAAAAAVw/IN3xC_vWayM/s1600/FullSizeRender.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaYTanCr7Eo/Vt_0_g1IWuI/AAAAAAAAAVw/IN3xC_vWayM/s320/FullSizeRender.jpg" width="135" /></a></div><div><br /></div></div>
