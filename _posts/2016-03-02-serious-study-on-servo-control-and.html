<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">After an hour discussion with Prof. Marshall, it seemed that I learn too little in the Servon part. The servo was controlled by the PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) where pulse width could change the angle of the servo and the frequency of this signal will change the speed of the servo. In this case, to control the servo properly, I will do an angle and speed adjustment on this servo.<br /><br />About how do I control this robotic arm, that is:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZtKXs6oo7M/VtXuv4d9s8I/AAAAAAAAAUs/o-4_N5v-R0I/s1600/Blank%2BFlowchart%2B-%2BNew%2BPage.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZtKXs6oo7M/VtXuv4d9s8I/AAAAAAAAAUs/o-4_N5v-R0I/s400/Blank%2BFlowchart%2B-%2BNew%2BPage.jpeg" width="400" /></a></div><br />From the diagram shown above, Green lines means the data getting from the class, and the red lines are sending data to the pool.You may see that there are much more getter lines than setter lines in this system,these are just ensure that the system variable could only be changed through the certain class and not modified by the getter functions.This flowchart just represent the abstract structure of the system or we can say how data flows.<br /><br />Why use velocity rather than position to control Haptic gripper and Robotic Gripper?<br /><br />There is no perfect matching,the best thing we could do, is synchronizing the speed of the motors.<br /><br />Another thing is that the Bench inspection will be held in 10 days which means it's the time to finish up the things I am currently doing. Will make a poster next week as well as a video clip.<br />Here is the Control Flow:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iAuYDbMxJ8o/VtX5jFdh7zI/AAAAAAAAAVA/NK47wAnlELs/s1600/Blank%2BFlowchart%2B-%2BNew%2BPage.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="309" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iAuYDbMxJ8o/VtX5jFdh7zI/AAAAAAAAAVA/NK47wAnlELs/s320/Blank%2BFlowchart%2B-%2BNew%2BPage.jpeg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">[Update] How to set a velocity, the velocity was simulated through the refresh period of each thread, in 50ms second, so it is something like add a certain value to the current position to achieve the velocity control. The velocity in the haptic device are the same rules however the delayed timer may be longer (depends much on the internet delay) Current_pos = Previous_pos&nbsp;+ vel * time (time is fixed in 50ms)</div><br /></div>
