<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After finish the day's FYP work, we had set up a discussion on our FYP projects. Considering the Neural Networks problem, for one of my friend, tried hard to use the Neural Networks to do the logic feature selections job, something feels like VLSI related subject. He wish to use NN to achieve the gesture recognition by using the cam on the computer. To simplify this problem, he made a gloves have 5 lights on the top of each finger, where the finger's position will be the coordinate of the light (Simplify the problem). Another feature is the hand size, as a gloves had limit the size of the 'hand'.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Under these two limitation, he began to collect the data, as coordinate in the frame, two frame as a series of actions and that's one sample. The sample are also the input of the system. (10 features (2* 5 fingers' coordinate) a sample). He had tried by adding neurons in each hidden layer and of course, starting from layer 1. As adding more neurons to the samples, the correction&nbsp;hypothesis&nbsp;rate of neurons are also changing. He record the highest number of neurons and take into account. Do it with 2 layers and three. You may image that the testing sets is changing from n to n^2 and n^3, same thing with time.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After three weeks' testing, we finally reach to 96% correct rate and had never reach to this high before, it may also indicate a necessary hypothesis, less likely to be&nbsp;overfitted. Now came to the question: Is that possible to have a scientific neurons model or relationship between different problems and solutions? Currently there are no person could actually find a key to every problem. However, it's quite meaningful also to my project, although the major focus on it is the control section, nobody had ever done a deep learning algorithm on the hardware because we already use the digital control optimization method. It may sounds silly that we have already have a damping model for a motor to move to any position smoothly in a&nbsp;certain&nbsp;speed, why we should apply a more complicated formula on this machine? It also raised to the question that, is that possible to have a certain model for a certain phenomenon, that we don't have to let people working on the formula but just let machine to fit itself through testing? Anyway, time to sleep now, see what I could do to finish my project. Hope anytime in the future I could also try that interesting CV project.</span></div></div>
