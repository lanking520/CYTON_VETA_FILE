<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">First week in Nov! Now the robot could move to anywhere if a necessary data is input. Small trick could be added on the CYTON like memorize the path and do some actions. All of them worked on Simple GUI. The focus now should be moved to the communication:<div><br /></div><div>1. Bluetooth Module (Tested by Pyserial--&gt;Worked, next one for ROS Serial)</div><div>2. RF Module (Communication between Board to board...Or a TTL+RX/TX) Raw test in summer and worked on board to board</div><div>3. WIFI Module (The ugly thing, computer being a host?) A virtual Controller on the website?</div><div><br /></div><div>Another stuff is the clamp.. That is too thick and narrow to put on the pressure sensor.. looks like some cuttings are needed. I will figure out ways next week..</div><div><br /></div></div>
