# Sensing Touch From a Robot Arm -- Qing's 2015-2016 Final Year Project

## General Description of The Project
The Robot with sensorsâ€™ feedback was becoming more significant in manufacturing, entertainment, medical areas in recent years. An important link to the feedback was the network among the machines and robots. Without the appropriate networks, the feedback from the robotic arm could be useless and even damage to the robotic system. This project focused on the force reflection from the robot arm and control it by using a joypad and Haptic Device. Network test applied after the system was finished. Two microcontrollers, two computers and a robot arm was the major hardware component used in the project. The final system design generally followed the operating system design rules with Processing Manager, Device Manager, Memory Manager, Network Manager and File Manager. Six different systems were built and 5 network models were tested to evaluate the performance of the Robotic Control system. Machine Learning, Forward and Inverse Kinematics and Robot Visualization was proved to be useful in the future system development.
